## 🚨 **Alerting & Notifications**

### **Manual Monitoring Approach**

**Check these metrics regularly:**

1. **Health Status:** Ensure `status: "OK"`
2. **Error Rate:** Should be < 5%
3. **Memory Usage:** Monitor for memory leaks
4. **Active Users:** Track user engagement
5. **Response Times:** Ensure fast performance

### **Automated Monitoring (Advanced)**

For production applications, consider:

1. **External Monitoring Services:**
   - UptimeRobot (free)
   - Pingdom
   - New Relic (free tier)

2. **Custom Monitoring Scripts:**
   - Cron jobs to check health endpoints
   - Slack/email notifications on errors
   - Log aggregation services

3. **Application Performance Monitoring:**
   - Error tracking (Sentry)
   - Performance monitoring
   - User analytics

## 🔧 **Interview Talking Points**

### **"How do you monitor your deployed application?"**

**Your Answer:**
> *"I implemented comprehensive real-time monitoring that tracks server performance, user activity, and application health. The system includes a live dashboard showing request analytics, active users, error rates, and memory usage. I can monitor everything from API endpoint usage to individual user activities, which helps me understand how the application is being used and identify any performance issues."*

### **"What metrics do you track?"**

**Your Answer:**
> *"I track several key metrics: server uptime and performance, total requests and response times, active user counts and session data, database connection status, error rates and recent failures, memory usage and resource consumption, and popular API endpoints. This gives me a complete picture of application health and user engagement."*

### **"How do you handle application errors in production?"**

**Your Answer:**
> *"I have error tracking built into the monitoring system that captures failed requests, logs error details, tracks error rates over time, and provides real-time error notifications. The dashboard shows recent errors with timestamps, request details, and user information, allowing me to quickly identify and address issues."*
